##Patent Issues

All of the code in Zint is developed using information in the public domain, usually freely available on the Internet. Some of the techniques used may be subject to patents and other intellectual property legislation. It is my belief that any patents involved in the technology underlying symbologies utilised by Zint are 'unadopted', that is the holder does not object to their methods being used. If, however, you are a patent holder or hold any other intellectual property rights on the methods used by Zint or the symbologies which Zint generates, and do not want Zint to continue to support your symbology then please contact me and I will update the code to accommodate your wishes at the soonest opportunity.
Any methods patented or owned by third parties or trademarks or registered trademarks used within Zint or in this document are and remain the property of their respective owners and do not indicate endorsement or affiliation with those owners, companies or organisations.
